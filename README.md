## Areas of Specialization
### 🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI)
**Artificial Intelligence** is my true passion. I have extensively explored machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and other exciting fields within AI. I'm always looking for ways to apply AI to enhance people's lives and simplify complex tasks.
### 👁️ Computer Vision
**Computer Vision** is a fascinating field that I have dedicated considerable time to. I've worked on projects involving sound classification, object detection, and pattern recognition using cutting-edge computer vision techniques and frameworks.
## Notable Projects
Here are some of my standout projects on GitHub:

### [Minecraft Zombie Sound Recognition 🧟‍♂️](https://github.com/manuamest/AA):
I developed a sound recognition system that can identify zombie sounds in the popular game Minecraft. This project uses machine learning to distinguish zombie noises from other in-game sounds, enhancing the player's experience.

### [Magic Square Solver 🧮](https://github.com/manuamest/MagicSquare):
I created an algorithm to solve magic squares, which are mathematical puzzles where the sum of numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same. This project demonstrates my mathematical problem-solving skills.

### [Shingoki Puzzle Solver 🧩](https://github.com/manuamest/ShingokiSolver):
I developed a solver for Shingoki puzzles, a challenging logic puzzle involving connecting points on a grid. My program efficiently finds solutions to these puzzles, showcasing my problem-solving and algorithmic abilities.
