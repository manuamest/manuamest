Hello! I'm Manu, a Computer Engineering student with a specialization in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Computer Vision**. My passion for technology and AI has led me to explore different areas within the field of computer science. This is my virtual corner where I share my projects and learnings. Let me introduce you to some of the technologies and areas I've developed into during my academic journey:

## Areas of Specialization
### 💻 Software Development
I'm passionate about software development and have worked on a variety of projects using different programming languages such as Python, C, C++, Java, and JavaScript. From web applications to desktop applications, I enjoy solving problems and creating elegant solutions.

### 🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI)
**Artificial Intelligence** is my true passion. I have extensively explored machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and other exciting fields within AI. I'm always looking for ways to apply AI to enhance people's lives and simplify complex tasks.

### 👁️ Computer Vision
**Computer Vision** is a fascinating field that I have dedicated considerable time to. I've worked on projects involving sound classification, object detection, and pattern recognition using cutting-edge computer vision techniques and frameworks.

## Notable Projects
Here are some of my standout projects on GitHub:

### [Minecraft Zombie Sound Recognition 🧟‍♂️](https://github.com/manuamest/PracticasAA):
I developed a sound recognition system that can identify zombie sounds in the popular game Minecraft. This project uses machine learning to distinguish zombie noises from other in-game sounds, enhancing the player's experience.

### [Magic Square Solver 🧮](https://github.com/manuamest/MagicSquare):
I created an algorithm to solve magic squares, which are mathematical puzzles where the sum of numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same. This project demonstrates my mathematical problem-solving skills.

### [Shingoki Puzzle Solver 🧩](https://github.com/manuamest/ShingokiSolver):
I developed a solver for Shingoki puzzles, a challenging logic puzzle involving connecting points on a grid. My program efficiently finds solutions to these puzzles, showcasing my problem-solving and algorithmic abilities.

### Custom Computer Vision Filters 📸 (private): 
In this project, I built custom computer vision filters from scratch. I experimented with image processing techniques to create unique and creative filters, demonstrating my skills in image manipulation.

### Natural Language Processing Tool 📝 (private): 
I created a natural language processing tool that can analyze and extract insights from textual data. This project includes sentiment analysis, text summarization, and keyword extraction, highlighting my expertise in **NLP**.

## Continuous Learning 📚
I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to learn and grow in the fields of computer science, **artificial intelligence**, and **computer vision**. My goal is to contribute to exciting projects and collaborate with individuals who share a passion for technology.
